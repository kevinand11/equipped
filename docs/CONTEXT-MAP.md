# Context Map

All agent-facing docs live under `docs/`; code lives under `src/`. Per-subsystem
domain docs sit at `docs/<context>/CONTEXT.md` (mirroring the `src/` layout);
ADRs live at `docs/adr/` regardless of which subsystem they affect (single
canonical location).

## Contexts

| Context | Domain doc            |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| `orm`   | `docs/orm/CONTEXT.md` |

Add a new row when a subsystem's vocabulary stabilises enough to deserve its own
`CONTEXT.md`. `/grill-with-docs` creates these lazily as terms get resolved.

## ADRs

All architectural decision records live at `docs/adr/`, named with an
ISO-date prefix (`YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`) so parallel branches can land
without renumbering conflicts. Each ADR's title or first paragraph should
make clear which context(s) it affects.
